# Backup and Recovery Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for backing up critical data and recovering the system in case of failure. It ensures business continuity and minimizes data loss.

## 1. Data to Backup

The following critical data components are identified for backup:

*   **Primary Database:**
    *   **Type:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (or specify the actual database used)
    *   **Content:** Contains all application data managed by Payload CMS, including user information, content, orders, etc.
*   **Media/File Storage:**
    *   **Type:** AWS S3 (or specify the actual object storage service)
    *   **Content:** Stores user-uploaded files, images, videos, and other media assets not stored directly in the database.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Type:** Secrets Manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) definitions (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
    *   **Content:** Environment variables, API keys, database credentials, third-party service configurations, and infrastructure definitions.
*   **Code Repository:**
    *   **Type:** Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
    *   **Content:** Application source code, deployment scripts, and related development artifacts. Backup is implicitly handled by the Git provider's infrastructure.

## 2. Backup Strategy

The following strategies are employed for backing up the identified data:

*   **Database Backups:**
    *   **Method:** Utilize the managed database service's automated snapshot feature (e.g., AWS RDS Snapshots, MongoDB Atlas Backups).
    *   **Frequency:** Daily automated snapshots.
    *   **Retention:** Snapshots retained for 30 days.
    *   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):** Enabled with a granularity of 5 minutes, allowing recovery to any point within the retention window (e.g., last 7 days).
*   **Media Backups:**
    *   **Method:** Leverage S3 bucket versioning to keep a history of all file changes and deletions.
    *   **Replication:** (Optional) Configure cross-region replication for disaster recovery purposes if required by availability needs.
*   **Configuration Backups:**
    *   **Secrets:** Utilize versioning features within the secrets management tool. Regularly audit and back up critical secrets manually or via script if versioning is insufficient.
    *   **IaC:** Store infrastructure definitions in the Git repository, leveraging version control for history and backup.

## 3. Recovery Strategy

The recovery strategy focuses on minimizing downtime and data loss:

*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 15 minutes. This represents the maximum acceptable data loss. This aligns with the PITR granularity and potential lag in log shipping.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 1 hour. This represents the maximum acceptable downtime for critical system functions following a disaster.

*   **Recovery Procedures (High-Level):**
    1.  **Assess Incident:** Determine the scope and nature of the failure.
    2.  **Restore Database:**
        *   If recent data is critical: Use PITR to restore the database to the latest possible point before the incident.
        *   If PITR is not feasible or required: Restore from the latest available daily snapshot.
    3.  **Restore Media:** If necessary (e.g., bucket corruption), restore files from S3 versions or the cross-region replica. Usually, S3 durability makes this step unnecessary for common failures.
    4.  **Restore Configuration:** Retrieve necessary secrets from the secrets manager. Apply the correct version of IaC definitions if infrastructure needs rebuilding.
    5.  **Redeploy Application:** Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the latest stable version of the application, connecting it to the restored database and configuration.
    6.  **Verify System:** Perform checks to ensure the application is functioning correctly with the restored data.

## 4. Testing

Regular testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the backup and recovery plan:

*   **Backup Verification:** Monthly checks to confirm backups are being created successfully and are restorable (e.g., test restore of a snapshot to a temporary instance).
*   **Recovery Drills:** Annual full recovery drill simulating a failure scenario to test the procedures, identify gaps, and measure actual RTO.
