# Database Migration Strategy

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategy for managing database schema changes within the Flow Masters project, specifically focusing on leveraging Payload CMS's capabilities. Database migrations are essential for ensuring that changes to the database schema are applied consistently, reliably, and in a version-controlled manner across all environments (development, staging, production). This prevents inconsistencies and ensures that the application code always interacts with the expected database structure.

## 2. Tooling

Our primary tool for managing database migrations is the **built-in migration system provided by Payload CMS**. Payload is designed to handle schema changes based on the collection and field configurations defined within the `payload.config.ts` file.

While external tools like Flyway or Liquibase exist, we will rely on Payload's integrated features unless a specific, complex scenario arises that necessitates evaluating other options.

## 3. Migration Generation

Payload CMS typically generates migration files automatically when changes are detected in the collection or global configurations (`payload.config.ts`). When you modify your configuration (e.g., add a field, change a field type, add a collection), Payload's development mode or specific CLI commands can generate the necessary migration script.

*   **Automatic Generation (Development):** During development, Payload can often prompt to generate migrations when configuration changes are detected upon startup.
*   **Manual Trigger:** Migrations can also be explicitly generated using Payload CLI commands (e.g., `payload migrate:generate`).

Generated migration files are typically timestamped and stored within the project structure (often in a `migrations` directory), allowing them to be committed to version control (Git).

## 4. Migration Application

Applying migrations is a critical step in the deployment process.

*   **When:** Migrations must be applied **before** the new application code that depends on those schema changes is deployed. This ensures the database schema is ready for the updated application logic.
*   **How:** Migrations are applied using Payload CMS CLI commands, typically integrated into our CI/CD pipeline. The command `payload migrate` (or similar, depending on version/configuration) executes pending migration scripts against the target database.
*   **Environments:** Migrations are applied sequentially across environments:
    1.  **Development:** Applied locally during the development cycle.
    2.  **Staging:** Applied automatically via the CI/CD pipeline during deployment to the staging environment. Thorough testing occurs here.
    3.  **Production:** Applied automatically via the CI/CD pipeline during deployment to the production environment, only after successful validation in staging.

## 5. Handling Migration Failures

Database migration failures can occur due to various reasons (syntax errors, data conflicts, infrastructure issues).

*   **Detection:** The CI/CD pipeline should monitor the exit status of the migration command. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.
*   **Rollback Strategy:**
    *   **Automatic Rollback (if supported):** Some migration tools/scripts might support automatic rollback on failure. However, Payload's default generated migrations might not always be easily reversible automatically.
    *   **Manual Intervention:** If a migration fails, the deployment process should halt immediately.
    *   **Database Restoration:** The primary rollback mechanism is often restoring the database from the latest backup taken *before* the migration attempt.
    *   **Fix Forward:** Alternatively, if the issue is minor and understood, a developer might create a *new* migration script to correct the problem and then re-run the migration process. This is often preferred over complex rollbacks if feasible.
*   **Alerting:** Failed migration attempts must trigger alerts to the development team for immediate investigation.

## 6. Seeding Data

It's important to distinguish between **schema migrations** and **data seeding**.

*   **Schema Migrations:** Modify the structure of the database (tables, columns, types, indexes). Handled by the migration tooling described above.
*   **Data Seeding:** Populates the database with initial or test data. This is typically handled by separate scripts or Payload hooks (e.g., `afterChange` hooks on collections, or dedicated seeding scripts run manually or via the CI/CD pipeline *after* migrations). Seeding scripts should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

Seed data for development and staging environments might differ significantly from production (which often starts empty or with essential baseline data).

## 7. Best Practices

*   **Version Control:** Always commit migration files to Git along with the code changes that require them.
*   **Keep Migrations Small:** Each migration should represent a single, atomic change to the schema. Avoid bundling unrelated changes into one migration.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Test migrations rigorously in the staging environment with data resembling production data before applying them to production.
*   **Reversibility:** Write migrations to be reversible whenever possible. While Payload's auto-generated migrations might handle some of this, manually crafted migrations should ideally include logic for both `up` (apply) and `down` (revert) operations if manual scripting is ever needed.
*   **Backup Before Migrating:** Always ensure a reliable database backup is taken immediately before applying migrations in staging and production environments.
*   **Coordinate Deployments:** Ensure application code deployments are coordinated with database migrations. Never deploy code that relies on schema changes before those changes have been successfully applied.
*   **Monitor Performance:** Be mindful of the performance implications of schema changes (e.g., adding indexes). Monitor database performance after applying migrations.
