# Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for observing the application's health, performance, and security posture in the production environment.

## 1. Logging Strategy

A robust logging strategy is crucial for debugging issues, understanding application behavior, and security auditing.

*   **Approach:** Centralized logging will be employed. Logs from all application components (backend, frontend, infrastructure) will be aggregated into a single system. Depending on the deployment environment, this could be a cloud provider service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging) or a dedicated logging platform (e.g., Datadog, Logtail, Sematext).
*   **Log Levels:** Standard log levels will be used:
    *   `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically used only during development or targeted debugging.
    *   `INFO`: General operational information, confirming things are working as expected.
    *   `WARN`: Potentially harmful situations or unexpected events that do not necessarily stop execution.
    *   `ERROR`: Errors that prevent a specific operation from completing but allow the application to continue running.
    *   `FATAL`: Severe errors that cause the application or service to terminate.
    *   **Production Log Level:** The default log level in production will be `INFO` to capture essential operational data without excessive verbosity. This can be temporarily adjusted for specific debugging needs.
*   **Log Content:** Logs should contain sufficient context to be useful:
    *   Timestamp (UTC with timezone offset).
    *   Log level.
    *   Service/Component name.
    *   Request ID (for tracing requests across services).
    *   User ID (where applicable and compliant with privacy regulations).
    *   Clear message describing the event.
    *   Stack traces for errors.
    *   Key application events (e.g., user login, order creation, background job completion).
*   **Format:** Logs will be formatted as **JSON**. Structured logging enables easier parsing, filtering, and analysis by logging platforms.

## 2. Monitoring Strategy

Monitoring provides real-time insights into the application's performance and resource utilization.

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** An APM tool (e.g., Datadog APM, Sentry Performance, OpenTelemetry-based solution) will be integrated to:
    *   Trace requests across distributed services.
    *   Monitor database query performance.
    *   Track performance of external API calls.
    *   Identify application-level bottlenecks.
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Core infrastructure metrics will be monitored using cloud provider tools (e.g., CloudWatch Metrics, Google Cloud Monitoring) or the APM agent:
    *   Compute Resources (Containers/VMs): CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
    *   Database: Connection counts, query latency, replication lag (if applicable), resource utilization.
    *   Cache (e.g., Redis): Memory usage, hit/miss ratio, latency.
*   **Key Metrics:** Dashboards will be set up to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs):
    *   Request Latency: Average, p50, p90, p99 percentiles.
    *   Error Rates: HTTP 5xx, HTTP 4xx (especially 401/403, 429).
    *   Throughput: Requests per second/minute.
    *   Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, disk space across all components.
    *   Database Performance: Query times, connection pool usage.
    *   Queue Lengths (if using message queues).
*   **Frontend Monitoring:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) and error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry Frontend, Datadog RUM) will be used to capture:
    *   Page Load Times & Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).
    *   JavaScript errors and their context (browser, OS, user actions).
    *   Frontend API request performance and failures.

## 3. Alerting Strategy

Alerting ensures that the team is promptly notified of critical issues affecting the application or its users.

*   **Critical Alerts:** Alerts will be configured for conditions indicating significant problems:
    *   High percentage of server errors (HTTP 5xx).
    *   Sustained high request latency exceeding defined SLOs.
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU > 90% for X minutes, Memory > 90%, Disk space < 10% free).
    *   Application/Service unavailability (health check failures).
    *   Critical database issues (e.g., high connection count, excessive replication lag).
    *   Security events (e.g., significant increase in 403s, potential DDoS activity detected by WAF).
    *   Background job failures or significant queue backlog.
*   **Thresholds:** Alert thresholds will be defined based on historical performance data and business requirements, aiming to minimize false positives while catching real issues promptly. Thresholds will be reviewed and adjusted periodically.
*   **Notification Channels:** Alerts will be routed based on severity:
    *   High Severity (Urgent): PagerDuty (or similar on-call notification system), dedicated Slack channel.
    *   Medium Severity (Requires Attention): Slack channel, Email.
    *   Low Severity (Informational): Slack channel (potentially throttled).
*   **On-Call Rotation/Runbooks:** An on-call rotation schedule will be established. Basic runbooks or troubleshooting guides should be linked within alerts where possible to expedite incident response.
