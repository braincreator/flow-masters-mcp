# Production Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the high-level strategy for deploying the Flow Masters application (Next.js Frontend + Payload CMS Backend) to a production environment.

## 1. Target Environment

*   **Cloud Provider:** The application will be deployed to a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). Specific services mentioned assume AWS for illustrative purposes but can be mapped to equivalents in GCP or Azure.
*   **Infrastructure:** Managed services will be preferred for scalability, reliability, and maintainability (e.g., Managed Kubernetes/Container Service, Managed Database, Managed Cache, CDN).
*   **Networking:** Deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with appropriate security groups/firewall rules.

## 2. Key Components

The production deployment will consist of the following core components:

*   **Next.js Frontend:** Serves the user interface. Deployed as a containerized application.
*   **Payload CMS Backend:** Serves the API, admin interface, and manages content. Deployed as a containerized application.
*   **Database:** Persistent storage for Payload CMS (e.g., Managed PostgreSQL - AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL).
*   **Cache:** (Optional but Recommended) In-memory data store for session management or caching (e.g., Managed Redis/Memcached - AWS ElastiCache, Google Memorystore, Azure Cache for Redis).
*   **Object Storage:** For media files managed by Payload CMS (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
*   **Container Registry:** Stores built Docker images (e.g., AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry).
*   **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic to frontend and backend services (e.g., AWS ALB/NLB, Google Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer).
*   **CDN:** Caches static assets and potentially frontend pages closer to users (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, Azure CDN).

## 3. Deployment Method

*   **Containerization:** Both the Next.js frontend and Payload CMS backend will be packaged as Docker images. `Dockerfile`s should be optimized for production (multi-stage builds, minimal base images, security best practices).
*   **Orchestration:** Containers will be deployed and managed using a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes - EKS/GKE/AKS, or simpler managed services like AWS ECS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps). This provides scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.
*   **CI/CD:** (Recommended) An automated CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI) should be implemented to build, test, and deploy images upon code merges to the main branch.

## 4. High-Level Deployment Steps

1.  **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Set up or verify the necessary cloud infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups, database, cache, object storage, container registry, orchestrator cluster/service) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation is recommended.
2.  **Build Artifacts:** Build production-ready Docker images for both the frontend and backend applications via the CI/CD pipeline or manually.
3.  **Push Artifacts:** Tag and push the built Docker images to the container registry.
4.  **Database Migrations:** Before deploying the new backend code, run any necessary database migrations against the production database. This might require a brief maintenance window or careful coordination.
5.  **Deploy Backend:** Deploy the new backend container image using the orchestrator's deployment strategy (e.g., rolling update, blue/green). Ensure health checks are configured correctly.
6.  **Deploy Frontend:** Deploy the new frontend container image using the orchestrator's deployment strategy.
7.  **Configure CDN/Load Balancer:** Update CDN cache rules or invalidations if necessary. Ensure the load balancer targets the new, healthy instances.
8.  **Run Final Checks:** Perform smoke tests and verify application health through monitoring tools.

## 5. Rollback Strategy

A rollback plan is crucial in case of deployment failure:

*   **Application Code:** The orchestrator should support easy rollback to the previous stable Docker image version for both frontend and backend services. Automated rollback based on health checks is ideal.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Backup:** Always take a database backup before running migrations.
    *   **Reversible Migrations:** Write migrations that can be reversed if possible.
    *   **Restore:** In a critical failure scenario, restoring from the pre-deployment backup might be necessary (involves data loss since the backup).
*   **Procedure:** The rollback procedure should be documented and tested periodically. Triggering a rollback should be a straightforward action via the orchestrator or CI/CD pipeline.
