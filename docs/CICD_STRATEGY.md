# CI/CD Strategy for Flow Masters

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) strategy for the Flow Masters project. The primary goals of implementing this CI/CD pipeline are:

*   **Automation:** Automate the build, testing, and deployment processes to reduce manual effort and potential errors.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure every change goes through the same standardized process, leading to more reliable builds and deployments.
*   **Faster Releases:** Enable quicker and more frequent delivery of new features, improvements, and bug fixes to users.
*   **Improved Quality:** Integrate automated testing early in the development cycle to catch issues sooner.

## 2. Tools

We will utilize **GitHub Actions** as our primary CI/CD platform. GitHub Actions provides robust integration with our GitHub repository, offers a wide range of community actions, and supports containerized workflows.

## 3. Branching Strategy

We will adopt a variation of the Gitflow branching model:

*   **`main`:** Represents the production-ready state. Only stable, tested code is merged here. Deployments to Production are triggered from this branch.
*   **`develop`:** Serves as the primary integration branch. Features are merged into `develop` after they are completed and reviewed. Deployments to the Staging environment are triggered from this branch.
*   **`feature/<feature-name>`:** Feature branches are created from `develop`. All development work for a specific feature happens here. Pull requests are opened from feature branches back into `develop`.
*   **`hotfix/<fix-name>`:** (Optional) Used for urgent fixes needed in production. Branched from `main`, merged back into both `main` and `develop`.
*   **`release/<version>`:** (Optional) Used for preparing production releases if more complex coordination is needed beyond merging `develop` to `main`.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

The CI pipeline focuses on integrating code changes frequently and verifying their correctness.

*   **Trigger:**
    *   Push to any `feature/*` branch.
    *   Pull request opened/updated targeting the `develop` branch.
    *   Merge into the `develop` branch.
*   **Steps (GitHub Actions Workflow):**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the latest source code from the triggering branch/PR.
    2.  **Setup Environment:**
        *   Set up Node.js (using the version specified in `.nvmrc` or `package.json`).
        *   Set up Docker environment (if needed for specific steps like integration tests requiring services).
    3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` for both the Payload CMS backend and the Next.js frontend.
    4.  **Linting:** Run linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to enforce code style and catch potential issues (`npm run lint` or `yarn lint`).
    5.  **Unit Tests:** Execute unit tests for backend and frontend (`npm run test:unit` or `yarn test:unit`).
    6.  **Integration Tests:** Run integration tests (may require spinning up dependent services like a test database) (`npm run test:integration` or `yarn test:integration`).
    7.  **Build Application:**
        *   Build Payload CMS backend (`npm run build` or `yarn build` in the backend directory).
        *   Build Next.js frontend (`npm run build` or `yarn build` in the frontend directory).
    8.  **Build Docker Images:** Build Docker images for the Payload backend and Next.js frontend, tagging them appropriately (e.g., with the Git commit SHA).
    9.  **(Optional) Push Docker Images to Registry:** Push the built images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR) tagged with the commit SHA or branch name for non-production builds.

## 5. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) Pipeline

The CD pipeline focuses on deploying the verified application to different environments.

*   **Environments:**
    *   **Staging:** A pre-production environment mirroring production as closely as possible. Used for final testing and validation before releasing to users.
    *   **Production:** The live environment accessible to end-users.
*   **Trigger:**
    *   **Staging:** Merge into the `develop` branch.
    *   **Production:** Merge into the `main` branch.

### 5.1 Staging Deployment

*   **Trigger:** Merge to `develop`.
*   **Steps (GitHub Actions Workflow):**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the code from the `develop` branch.
    2.  **Build Docker Images:** (Could potentially reuse images built in CI if registry is used, or rebuild). Tag images specifically for staging (e.g., `develop-<commit-sha>`).
    3.  **Push Docker Images:** Push images to the container registry.
    4.  **Deploy to Staging:** Trigger deployment to the staging infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, managed container service). This involves updating the running containers with the new image tags.
    5.  **Run Database Migrations:** Execute any necessary database schema migrations against the staging database.
    6.  **Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Execute automated E2E tests (e.g., using Cypress, Playwright) against the deployed staging environment.
    7.  **Notify:** Send notification (e.g., Slack, Teams) about successful staging deployment.

### 5.2 Production Deployment

*   **Trigger:** Merge to `main`.
*   **Steps (GitHub Actions Workflow):**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the code from the `main` branch.
    2.  **(Optional) Manual Approval Gate:** Require manual approval from a designated team member/lead before proceeding with the production deployment (configurable in GitHub Actions environments).
    3.  **Build Docker Images:** (Could potentially reuse images built in CI/CD for `develop`/`main` if registry is used, or rebuild). Tag images specifically for production (e.g., `latest`, `<version-number>`, `main-<commit-sha>`).
    4.  **Push Docker Images:** Push images to the container registry.
    5.  **Deploy to Production:** Trigger deployment to the production infrastructure. This might involve strategies like blue-green deployment or canary releases for zero-downtime updates.
    6.  **Run Database Migrations:** Execute database migrations against the production database (handle with care, potentially requiring maintenance windows or specific strategies).
    7.  **Run Smoke Tests:** Execute a small suite of critical-path tests against the production environment to ensure basic functionality is working.
    8.  **Monitoring Checks:** Verify that monitoring systems (e.g., uptime checks, error rates) report healthy status after deployment.
    9.  **Notify:** Send notification about successful production deployment.

### 5.3 Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment failure or critical issues discovered post-deployment:

*   **Automated Rollback:** Configure deployment tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to automatically roll back to the previous stable version if health checks fail after an update.
*   **Manual Rollback:** Manually trigger a deployment using the previously known stable Docker image tag. This can be done by re-running the deployment pipeline with the specific tag or using infrastructure-specific commands.
*   **Hotfix:** For issues requiring code changes, create a `hotfix` branch from `main`, fix the issue, test, and merge back to `main` and `develop`, triggering a new deployment.
